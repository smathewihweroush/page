                    <p>I am <i style="text-decoration: dotted underline;" title="This is my alias, not my real name.">smathewih</i>, and this is 
                        my website where I share my thoughts and share information about myself. 
                        I will also put fun things like easter eggs or "minigames" here because I feel like it. <br>
                        I like to do many things in my free time, a lot of them including creative expression such as drawing, creating music,
                        writing but I am also a good programmer. <br> <br>
                        I can program in many languages such as C++, C#, Java, Python, Lua, GDScript,
                        GMScript, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but my primary programming languages are C++ for competitive programming, Python
                        for simpler tasks, GDScript for Godot and HTML/CSS/JS for web development. However, I am best in C++ and C# for some reason.
